# 👋 Hello! Welcome to My GitHub

I'm a **Data Analyst** with a unique blend of Agricultural Economics and Extension expertise—turning raw data into powerful stories that help businesses bloom 🌾📊

With hands-on experience in **Excel**, **Power BI**, **SQL**, and **Python**, I specialize in transforming messy data and hidden database nuggets into sleek dashboards, smart insights, and meaningful strategies.

## 🎯 What I Excel At

- 🧹 **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
  Ensuring datasets are accurate, consistent, organized, and ready for analysis.

- 🔍 **Spotting Golden Nuggets**  
  Digging deep to uncover trends, KPIs, and opportunities that matter.

- 📊 **Creating Dashboards That Wow**  
  Beautiful Power BI and Excel reports that speak louder than tables, that communicate clearly.

- 🛢️ **SQL Sleuthing**  
  Writing efficient queries to pull the *right* data at the *right* time.

- 🔁 **Magic with Automation**  
  Saving hours (and headaches) with Power Query and Excel Macros.

- 🤝 **Cross-functional Collaboration**  
  Coordinating teams to ensure smooth project execution and results delivery.

## 🌟 Why I Stand Out

I don’t just work with numbers—I **listen** to them. I craft narratives that fuel decisions, optimize performance, and make complex insights digestible. Whether you're a startup or a global enterprise, I help teams act smarter, faster, and with confidence. I combine domain expertise with a strong storytelling mindset, crafting data narratives that resonate with stakeholders. Whether optimizing performance metrics or building decision-making tools, I bring clarity, precision, and creativity to every project.
